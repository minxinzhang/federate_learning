## Requirements

This project requires:
1. Pytorch: 
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
install method `python3 -m pip install torch`
2. Matplotlib: 
https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/getting_started/index.html#installation-quick-start
install method `python3 -m pip install matplotlib`

## How to run the demo

1. Run the server program first of all by either

`python3 COMP3221_FLServer.py 6000 0`
to disable subsampling mode or

`python3 COMP3221_FLServer.py 6000 1`
to enable subsampling of 2 devices. 

*Note that subsampling only exchanges 1 local model data if there's only one device connected to the server at a moment.*

After `COMP3221_FLServer.py` is running, you will see:
>[SERVER] Listening on port 6000<br>
>The server will use a non subsampling aggregation<br>
>[SERVER] Now please run client commands using Normal GD flag

2. Run client programs on different terminals by
`python3 COMP3221_FLClient.py <clientid> 600(x) [0|5|10|20]`

Follow the last prompt message from the server terminal to 
run clients as instructed.
For example:<br>
If you see 
>[SERVER] Now please run client commands using Normal GD flag

, run `python3 COMP3221_FLClient.py client1 6001 0` to launch 
the `client1` device.

Similarly,
>[SERVER] Now please run client commands using Mini Batch of 5 flag

run `python3 COMP3221_FLClient.py client1 6001 5` accordingly.

*Note that ::`clientid`:: is case sensitive. ::`clientid`:: is used to load data from the FLdata directory. ::`600(x)`:: is a placeholder to simulate the port number to which a client binds. My implementation let server handles socket pipes. You can use ::`6001`:: for all clients*

3. To achieve the graphical output generated by the "Matplotlib", you need to handle all 4 rounds of server instructions as

>[SERVER] Now please run client commands using Normal GD flag<br>
>[SERVER] Now please run client commands using Mini Batch of 5 flag<br>
>[SERVER] Now please run client commands using Mini Batch of 10 flag<br>
>[SERVER] Now please run client commands using Mini Batch of 20 flag<br>

*During each instruction round ::`clientid`:: logs terminal output under the same directory. E.g. ::`clientid_gd_log.txt`:: file for the GD simulation. ::`client1_batch_size_5_log.txt`:: for the Mini batch GD of size 5 simulation*
